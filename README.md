Well-Toned: iPad Music Application
================
This app allows for the production and proof reading of 4-part 
harmonies in the style of Bach on an interactive iPad surface. The user will 
be able to input each line of a SATB chorale into our scrollable staff, and 
when they are ﬁnished, an algorithm will check for mistakes in the 
composition. These errors include parallel ﬁfths and parallel octaves, among 
others.
